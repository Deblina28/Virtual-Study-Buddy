# Virtual-Study-Buddy
Excel in your studies with a complete virtual education assistant

## Inspiration
The current situation of students like us, having to acquire education online i.e. virtually because of the ongoing pandemic, was our inspiration behind building this project. Absolute online learning was a rather new concept to many individuals, as it came with its own challenges. We wanted to build a socially impactful project that not only helps students overcome the basic challenges of online learning but also helps students with disabilities to learn better virtually. 

## What it does
Virtual Study Buddy is a website that ensures that online classes easy and effective for students. Virtual Study Buddy not only helps students learn virtually but also helps teachers to teach better, as well as improve the learning for individuals who have certain disabilities. The feature of AR helps the children to connect more to the subject concepts by allowing learners them to interact with the visual representation of the aspect being taught, which increases the engagement level of students as well as provides them a hands-on implementation approach virtually.There is also a special feature of emotion detection, that allows teachers to detect and realise the mood of the students, so they can monitor the focus and engagement level of class and teach according to it.
