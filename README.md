# Virtual-Study-Buddy
Excel in your studies with a complete virtual education assistant

## Inspiration
The current situation of students like us, having to acquire education online i.e. virtually because of the ongoing pandemic, was our inspiration behind building this project. Absolute online learning was a rather new concept to many individuals, as it came with its own challenges. We wanted to build a socially impactful project that not only helps students overcome the basic challenges of online learning but also helps students with disabilities to learn better virtually. 

## What it does
Virtual Study Buddy is a website that ensures that online classes are easy and effective for students. Virtual Study Buddy not only helps students learn virtually but also helps teachers to teach better, as well as improve the learning for individuals who have certain disabilities. 

The feature of AR helps the children to connect more to the subject concepts by allowing learners to interact with the visual representation of the aspect being taught, which increases the engagement level of students as well as provides them a hands-on implementation approach virtually.

The Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text feature of the website is specially dedicated to making the lives of students easier, including those individuals with learning disabilities. As the name suggests, the Text-to-Speech feature allows students to hear the text notes/material in an audio form. The Text-to-Speech feature is incorporated keeping in mind the individuals with certain disabilities, for example, visually impaired individuals, learners with dyslexia, teachers with speaking disabilities, etc.
The Speech-to-Text Learning feature aims to help children who have writing disabilities. Using this feature, children will be able to speak and the computer will write whatever they say down for them. This can also help in taking notes.

There is also another special feature of emotion detection, that allows teachers to detect and realize the mood of the students, so they can monitor the focus and engagement level of class and teach according to it. 

## How we built it
First, we designed a prototype in **figma**. Then we made using replit as it gives the results in real-time. We have used CSS, HTML and JS and we also included machine learning
